          <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions and then drain.</li>
          <li>While the pasta is cooking, puree the tomatoes with their juice in a blender with the garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper.</li>
          <li>Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Careful of it splashing, pour the tomato puree into the hot oil and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss until coated. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with grated Parmesan.</li>
