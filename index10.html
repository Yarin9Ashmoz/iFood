        <p >The recipe is: </p>
        <ol style="text-align: left;">
          <li>In a food processor or blender, put the corn kernels and grind until a mixture is formed that is almost smooth but still with small pieces of corn. And you can also simply grind 3/4 of the grains to a fairly smooth texture and then add the remaining 1/4 and not grind them.</li>
          <li>Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Transfer to the refrigerator for an hour. If after the refrigerator the mixture is not stable enough to make meatballs, with wet hands so that the mixture does not stick to your hands, just add another 2-3 tablespoons of flour. It mainly depends on how much you ground the corn and how well you strained the liquid. </li>
          <li>Mix the sesame and bread crumbs in a bowl. </li>
          <li>Make meatballs with wet or greased hands and flatten into an oval shape.</li>
          <li>Wrap the corn patties in breadcrumbs and sesame seeds.</li>
          <li>Heat oil in a pan, at a height of 1/2 cm, and fry on both sides until golden.</li>
